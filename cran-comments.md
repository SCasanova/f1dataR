## Resubmission

This is a minor update to mirror upstream API changes.

Some new functions are added. 
An internal dataset is removed (the API now provides this data in a more up-to-date fashion).

This change also removes the `usethis` package from Suggests (it was only incorrectly included for building the internal dataset).
