## Resubmission

This is a minor update to mirror upstream API changes.

Some new functions are added. 

An internal data set is removed (the API now provides this data in a more up-to-date fashion).

This change also removes the `usethis` package from Suggests (it was only incorrectly included for building the internal data set) and updates the minimum R version to 3.5.0 (reflecting required package minimums).
