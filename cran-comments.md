## Resubmission

This is a bugfix requested by CRAN after some failures of automated testing due to internet resource unavailability. 
Our previous resubmission for the same issue corrected failure errors to graceful warnings but some testing failures snuck through. This is a testing update to match.

This update also includes a new vignette.
