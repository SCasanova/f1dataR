## Resubmission

This is a bugfix requested by CRAN after some failures of automated testing due to internet resource unavailability. 

The package has been updated to fail gracefully if the web resource is unavailable (previous action was a warning or error, case dependent). Further, flexibility on incomplete responses from the web API have been drastically improved.

This version update was requested by 17 March, should there be any issues with this submission please extend this deadline.
